# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment

### _I will code for at least 1.5 hours every day for the next 100 days._

#### Start Date

| Start Date | End Date |
| ---------- | -------- |
| 1 Sep 2018 | -------- |

## Additional Rules

1.  I will tweet :bird: about my progress every day -> using the hashtag [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofcode?src=hash)
2.  If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge
3.  More than two days off in a row or more than days off in a span of [14 days](https://zenhabits.net), the challenge is lost. :cry:
4.  I will push code to GitHub :muscle: every day so that anyone can see my progress.
5.  I will update the [Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link to my work so that others can see my progress.
6.  I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
