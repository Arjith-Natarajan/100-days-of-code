# Goals for Round 1

These are sort of my high level goals for this round of #100DaysOfCode. I am planning to use them also as a rough road map in terms of what technologies to learn or use in projects.

- [ ] Become even more better at React and React Native
- [ ] Learn Javascript Testing in formal way
- [ ] Build a personal website using Next.js
- [ ] Get Experienced with AWS Amplify and other allied services
- [ ] Learn CSS Properly : Property Names, SCSS, responsiveness
- [ ] Learning to build command line applications using javascript

Hopefully I'll be able to achieve these at the end of this round. Whatever not achieved I shall move it to my next round :P !
