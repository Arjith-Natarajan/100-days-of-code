# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1:

**Today's Progress**:

- Started with [Learning track](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) of Next.js & Completed with first 2 tasks
- Spent some quality time with docs of following section in Next.js site
  - [Intro to Routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction)
  - [Dynamic Routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes)
  - Static Generation

**Thoughts:**

- The idea is to understand next.js 's inner workings while simultaneously trying to build a minimal personal website.
- Felt good about starting this, let's see how I do in coming days
- The initial tasks seems fairly easy, I'm guessing they'd become trickier as well progress to more advanced concepts
- That is why I'm also considering reviving one of my abandoned projects, Sudoku grid and see if I can work on it in between these ones so that I don't get too much bored/tired.

**Work showcase / Progress :**

Trying to achieve something like: [this](https://next-learn-starter.now.sh/).
