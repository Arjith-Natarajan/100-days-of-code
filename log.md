# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- Completed a single programming task from codewars, came up with a functional non obvious solution
- Started with competitive coding seriously on different platforms,

**Thoughts:**

- I'm getting better in Js. and it is becoming my primary language of choice for solving problems. Array methods like splice, map, reduce are becoming my power tools.
- Also my algorithmic thinking has improved a lot via learning from other's solutions

**Today's Progress**:

- Completed two programming tasks, which I had left unfinished long back
- Started with Gatsby.js to create an awesome personal Website
- Setup a basic gatsby.js static site and hosted it in [surge.sh](https://surge.sh)

**Thoughts:**

- Going to make solving atleast one or two coding problems everyday(even partial) a routine
- Gatsby Seems to be a great choice for my personal portfolio site given my background in React. Exploring the [JAM Stack]()
